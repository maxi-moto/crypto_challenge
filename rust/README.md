# Crypto Challenge
These are my Rust solutions -- I'm still learning the language so please excuse
my beginner mistakes. Hopefully I can fix them as I learn.

# Notes:
I really like Rust. It's clean and clear. That said, I'm sure I haven't
followed convetions and there are most definately better ways to do this. I am
probably pretty hack-ish in my implementations.

### As of set 1, challenge 3
The hardest part so far has been reading a file. Hopefully I can figure it out
soon. I think I can do the XOR-ing ang everything. Just reading the damn thing.
