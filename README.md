# Crypto Challenge
My solutions to the Matasano Crypto Challenge.

I want to learn Rust and OCaml, so I thought I'd give it a shot with these
challenges. Please exucse any syntax or convention errors, I'll fix them as I
learn more!

On occasion, I might want to give these problems a shot in languages I use more
often, like C++ and Java. I might even try javascript just because.
