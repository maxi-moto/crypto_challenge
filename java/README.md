# Crypto Challenge: Java
These are my Java solutions.

# Notes:
### As of set 1, challenge 3
I can't say it's easier to work with Java over Rust, it might be. But I'm most
likely just more familiar with the language. By this point in Rust, I didn't
really have much trouble. The hardest part about Rust was dealing with reading
the input for challenge 4 from a text file.
