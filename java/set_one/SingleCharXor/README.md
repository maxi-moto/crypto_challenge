# Single Character XOR
For this challenge, I have decided to go with a full on OOP solution. 

For a while now, I've questioned why OOP was the de facto way to go for any and
all software solutions. For a lot of the assignments in my classes, after going
through all the entry level C/C++ courses that require object, I started asking
myself and classmates why we felt we had to make an object, or two, or three.
It was jsut as easy to call a function, and most of my objects ended up with
one or two methods -- hardly justifying their existance. And with unit tests,
which feel like they break the rules of OOP (principle of least privilege and
encapsulation), it seems even more uselss to make entire objects when all I
care about are the values their methods return. Especially for small projects
like these. 

But for some reason, I want to go full OOP.
